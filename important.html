                <p>Zendaya is a legendary actress who has moved up to the top of my favorites! I hope those that watch some of her shows notice the amount of hard work, effort, and skill she puts in. She is now 24 years old,(depending on when you view this website) and had started as the young Disney star actress we all admired in <i>Shake It Up</i>. Her whole life has been a total rollercoaster to the art of success. From being a young dancer in commercials to winning an Emmy for Euphoria she has come a long way to success. Throughout this page, I will be breaking down each important stage of her career, <strong>so read on to find out more.</strong></p>

                    <p>Zendaya's major acting role occurred when she earned the role of Rocky Blue for <i>Shake it Up</i>. At only being 13-14 years old, she demonstrated her talent to the world through her humorous character, as "Shake It Up" was named to be the highest-rated series in Disney Channel history, with a whopping <strong><i>6.2 million viewers.</i></strong> Next, after the ending of "Shake it Up" Zendaya took a break before returning to Disney. This time she gained more recognition as she became a producer on the show, "K.C. Undercover". Within the show, Zendaya plays an intelligent yet timid teenager, named K.C. Cooper, that goes on secret adventurous/action missions with her family. The reason "K.C. Undercover" may have been very appreciated is due to the action-packed scenes and miraculous stunts that deliver joy to the viewers. All of which lots of Disney Channel shows lacked.</p>

                <p>Zendaya's involvement showed us the importance of racial equality and the injustice of African-Americans. Ultimately, she proved that everyone should be equal in rights and opportunities regardless of race or gender. As I grew up and developed a more understanding of the world, I realized many of the shows on Disney Channel had a standard race of preference. Zendaya's idea to bring a different race to Disney is essential for young viewers to understand not just the idea of the show, but the real world as well. If you are reading this in 2020, you can relate to this, with everything that is going on in the world. We all know this isn't how we expected our lives to be, but that's how life is. Additionally, it not only provides comedy for younger kids, but it also teaches them the type of person to be. To sum up, the significant amount of viewers, unity, and injustice are all the reasons Zendaya is a significant figure in our lives. </p>

             <div class = "container">
                <p>After going from a Disney Star to earning a position in a huge blockbuster movie, <i>Spider-Man,</i> Zendaya has truly proven herself to be extremely inspirational. She demonstrated that with a little bit of hard work and determination, you can achieve your future goals. Yet, this isn't about her earning the role, it's about the significance of it. In comparison to the previous Spider-Man Movies, many can make the case that the majority of the cast is one race; Specifically, the person who plays "Mary Jane". However, Zendaya playing the role of"MJ", invokes a form of racial diversity in sony pictures/marvel. Ultimately, this also influences people everywhere, to not feel limited or have a negative approach to anything in life just because of their race. Regardless of the rank of her character, all that counts is Zendya's influential personality in the film. </p>

                <p>From Spider-Man, Zendaya continued to make her presence trending by starring in the HBO show, "Euphoria". Euphoria mainly encompasses the lives of selected high-schoolers, one of them being Rue Bennet(played by Zendaya) that often make the wrong choices, including drugs, alcohol, etc. We had often been used to her as the normal/smart teenager in the majority of her films, but I think she truly took a big step into earning a mature role, as a way for her to experience the growth of being an actor. As a result, so many people were finally able to witness what she is capable of as an actor! Her ability to connect with Rue so efficiently is what I think allows the viewers to understand the seriousness of the drama series. Thus, her talent speaks for herself as she was able to crown herself with an Emmy award in 2020!</p>
